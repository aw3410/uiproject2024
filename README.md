# ui-project-fall24
What Culpa Doesn't Tell You - CS Edition

We used HTML, CSS, and Python to develop these interfaces. We store our changes using a Flask backend. We have used JavaScript to add functionality to our project. This includes button functionality, navigation and search functionality, course review form functionality, and more. The course and professor pages are rendered dynamically with data in our Flask database. To run our code, navigate into the ui-project-fall24-main folder, and run python server.py in the command line. 

The routes that should be at the end of the URL for each page are as follows: 
Homepage : '/'
Review form page: '/reviewform'
Professor page: '/professor'
Course page: '/course'

You can also navigate through the course/professor page by entering a search or using the sidebar. The review form can be reached through the sidebar (with the review buttons), through the homepage, and through the course/professor review pages.
